I'm an aspiring Back-end Developer with a strong eagerness and passion to learn and utilize
technology to create efficient solutions for solving real-world problems. While I'm relatively
new in terms of working experience, I always seek opportunities to expand my skills and be
open to learning new technologies, methodologies and techniques to adapt to the evolving
needs of my career path.
